## Redis Lite Server
### This is my version of Redis server implementation in java. It can support the below commands:
1. INCR
2. DECR
3. SET
4. GET
5. PING
6. ECHO
7. DEL
8. EXISTS
9. EXIT

### You can try interacting with the server using REDIS CLI.
### For windows, You need to find the ethernet IPV4 address, If you run the redis-cli on wsl. You can get the IPV4 using ipconfig command
### Then pass this host and port details to the redis cli.
